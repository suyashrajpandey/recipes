    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Sprinkle the chicken with 2 teaspoons salt.</li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the
        chicken in the hot oil in batches until completely browned. Transfer the
        browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat under the skillet to medium-high; add the onion, garlic,
        and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet and cook and stir until
        the onion turns translucent, about 8 minutes. Stir the curry powder,
        cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the
        onion mixture; allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring.
        Mix the tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon
        salt into the mixture. Return the chicken breast to the skillet along
        with any juices on the plate. Pour 1/2 cup water into the mixture; bring
        to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle the
        garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the skillet and simmer until the chicken breasts are no longer
        pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An
        instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least
        165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with lemon juice to serve.
      </li>
    </ol>
